# Machine Learning Model for Absenteeism at WorkPrediction

## Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model developed to predict the absenteeism of employees based on various features. The model utilizes logistic regression, a widely-used classification algorithm, to classify whether an employee will be absent or not.

#Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of records of employee absenteeism, with each record containing information on various factors that may influence absenteeism. These factors include employee demographics, work-related variables, and lifestyle-related variables.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Prior to model development, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different variables. Visualizations and statistical summaries were used to identify patterns, trends, and potential correlations within the data.

#Model Development
The logistic regression algorithm was chosen for its simplicity, interpretability, and effectiveness in binary classification tasks. The model was trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated using appropriate performance metrics such as accuracy.

# Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python script containing the model implementation.
Run the notebook or script to train the model and make predictions.
